# Lab 5: The Monte Carlo Engine

This lab practices Monte Carlo simulation to model uncertainty and quantify risk.  
We build three simulations and one stress test:

1) Law of Large Numbers (coin flips)  
2) Monty Hall simulation (conditional probability)  
3) SaaS business revenue risk (VaR)  
4) Fat-tail stress test using Student’s t distribution (df=3)
